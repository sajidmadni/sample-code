This technique shifts all times int he messgae stable towards NOW():

MariaDB [pu_clean_121015]> select timediff(now(),max(created_at)) into @dt from private_message;

MariaDB [pu_clean_121015]> update private_message set created_at=ADDTIME(created_at,@dt),
        updated_at=addtime(updated_at,@dt),receipt_confirmed_at=addtime(receipt_confirmed_at,@dt); 
Query OK, 457936 rows affected (10.93 sec)
Rows matched: 457936  Changed: 457936  Warnings: 0

MariaDB [pu_clean_121015]> update private_message set created_at=ADDTIME(created_at,@dt),updated_at=addtime(updated_at,@dt),receipt_confirmed_at=addtime(receipt_confirmed_at,@dt) where sender_id=19505 or receiver_id=19505; 
Query OK, 1697 rows affected (0.08 sec)
